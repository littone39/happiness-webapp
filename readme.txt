DATA: World Happiness Report 2005-2021. Includes information from Gallup Poll about
country happiness (life ladder), gdp, social support, and other related quality of life 
statistics over time.

STATUS: Users can view data for a single country on the 'Map' page by clicking a country 
on the map or selecting one from the drop down menu. The data displayed is from the most 
recent year and then there is a small graph that shows happiness over time. Users can also 
create a scatter plot comparing happiness score to another variable on the page titled 
'Plot'. Navigation works and home/about pages provide additional information. 
All features are working.

NOTES: There are a few small quirks/things we couldn't figure out:
    - The chart axes don't start at zero which is annoying and we couldn't figure out how
    to fix it in a reasonable amount of time.
    - Similarly, clicking the dataset key on the charts makes the data disappear and we weren't able 
    to figure out how to remove it. 
    - The name of the 'Plot' page maybe isn't quite right -- we tried lots of different names
    ('compare', 'correlation', 'trends', etc.) and none of them quite fit.
